# Machine Learning API examples

These examples demonstrate how to use cloud-based ML APIs with [RPA Framework](/libraries/rpa-framework/). Currently, a selected set of services from [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) ([RPA.Cloud.AWS](/libraries/rpa-framework/rpa-cloud-aws/)), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) ([RPA.Cloud.Azure](/libraries/rpa-framework/rpa-cloud-azure/)) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) ([RPA.Cloud.Google](/libraries/rpa-framework/rpa-cloud-google/)) are available.

> NOTE: This example needs some manual configuration steps. You can find the full tutorial and instructions on [Robocorp's documentation site](https://www.robocorp.com/docs/development-howtos/ai-machine-learning/cloud-machine-learning-apis).
